## Election-Audit Summary
- This script can be modified to work for any election. You can modify the counties to include more counties in a certain area or different counties in all if the election was in a different state. You can just add the county names to the list that currently contain Denver, Jefferson and Arapahoe. You can also modify the candidate information. You can remove the current candidates and place the ones you want for a new election. This script can very easily be used for another election, given that you have election data.
